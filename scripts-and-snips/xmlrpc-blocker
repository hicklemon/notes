Varnish:

if (req.request == "POST" && req.url ~ "xmlrpc.php"){
    error 404 "Not Found.";
}

# The GET requests do not seem to be an issue, as our default Varnish VCL attempts to perform a lookup on those anyways:

if (req.request == "GET" && req.url ~ "(xmlrpc.php|wlmanifest.xml)") {
    remove req.http.cookie;
    return(lookup);
}

Apache:

<Files xmlrpc.php>
    Require all Denied
</Files>

Apache alternative method:

<filesmatch "xmlrpc.php"> 
    Redirect 403 /xmlrpc.php 
    ErrorDocument 403 "Access to this file is forbidden"
</filesmatch>

nginx:

location = /xmlrpc.php {
    deny all;
    access_log off; #to prevent from filling up the access log file
}
