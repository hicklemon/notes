# Let's say you've lost some data, but there's a process in memory keeping the file descriptor open, and you want to use it to get that file back.

$ tail -1 /database/mgslice.err

# Since the file's dead, try to read from the descriptor:

# Since the descriptor is open, try and copy it to a normal file:
$ cp -a /proc/19833/fd/3 mgslice.err

# Archive copy doesn't work:
$ file mgslice.err
mgslice.err: broken symbolic link to `/database/mgslice.err (deleted)'

# So we take a plain copy:
$ cp /proc/19833/fd/3 mgslice.err

# Check for headers or data structure:
$ file mgslice.err
mgslice.err: ASCII English text, with very long lines

# And view our recovered data:
$ tail -1 mgslice.err
